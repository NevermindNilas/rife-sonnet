Task Objective:
You are tasked with optimizing the performance and output quality of a video interpolation script based on RIFE version 4.6. Your primary goal is to improve CUDA inference speed and overall efficiency, while preserving full compatibility with the provided model weights.

Resources Provided:

    Model Weights: F:\rife-sonnet\rife46.pth

    Test Input: A Python list of 500 preloaded PyTorch tensors, simulating video frames.

Constraints:

    Do NOT modify any part of the model architecture or code that would break compatibility with rife46.pth.

    All optimizations must preserve the integrity and functionality of the current model weights.

    You may modify preprocessing, postprocessing, I/O handling, CUDA memory strategy, and logic outside the model definition itself.

Your Task:

    Run the script in a for-loop over 500 torch tensors representing synthetic input frames. Each tensor should match the expected input shape of the model (e.g., 3×H×W, float32, normalized as required).

    Measure baseline performance:

        Average frames per second (FPS)

        GPU memory usage

        CUDA utilization

    Identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., tensor transfers, model I/O, synchronization delays).

    Implement and test safe optimizations, including but not limited to:

        Asynchronous CUDA execution

        Double buffering

        Pre-allocating tensors

        Leveraging torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

        Any valid use of torch.compile() if it preserves model behavior

        Efficient batch-wise or pipeline parallel strategies if applicable

Deliverables:

    Baseline and post-optimization performance metrics

    Detailed list of optimizations applied with explanations

    Output verification steps (ensure interpolation results are valid and consistent)

    Confirmation that changes maintain full compatibility with the rife46.pth model
