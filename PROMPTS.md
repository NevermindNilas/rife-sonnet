Prompts used so far, I roughly write them down then use ChatGPT to format them better, I then apply very few tweaks.

PROMPT 1:

Task Objective:
You are tasked with optimizing the performance and output quality of a video interpolation script based on RIFE version 4.6. Your primary goal is to improve CUDA inference speed and overall efficiency, while preserving full compatibility with the provided model weights.

Resources Provided:

    Model Weights: F:\rife-sonnet\rife46.pth

    Test Input: A Python list of 500 preloaded PyTorch tensors, simulating video frames.

Constraints:

    Do NOT modify any part of the model architecture or code that would break compatibility with rife46.pth.

    All optimizations must preserve the integrity and functionality of the current model weights.

    You may modify preprocessing, postprocessing, I/O handling, CUDA memory strategy, and logic outside the model definition itself.

Your Task:

    Run the script in a for-loop over 500 torch tensors representing synthetic input frames. Each tensor should match the expected input shape of the model (e.g., 3×H×W, float32, normalized as required).

    Measure baseline performance:

        Average frames per second (FPS)

        GPU memory usage

        CUDA utilization

    Identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., tensor transfers, model I/O, synchronization delays).

    Implement and test safe optimizations, including but not limited to:

        Asynchronous CUDA execution

        Double buffering

        Pre-allocating tensors

        Leveraging torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

        Any valid use of torch.compile() if it preserves model behavior

        Efficient batch-wise or pipeline parallel strategies if applicable

Deliverables:

    Baseline and post-optimization performance metrics

    Detailed list of optimizations applied with explanations

    Output verification steps (ensure interpolation results are valid and consistent)

    Confirmation that changes maintain full compatibility with the rife46.pth model

------------------

PROMPT 2:

I want to benchmark the performance of the improved rife script using both FP32 and FP16 precision. First, establish baseline performance metrics for both formats. Then gather new performance metrics using the optimized rife. Finally, compare the outputs from the optimized FP32 and optimized FP16 runs to assess any differences in quality or numerical stability.

Your goals:

    Measure and report baseline FPS and GPU usage for FP32 and FP16.

    Optimize performance (e.g., memory, compute, I/O) while maintaining model compatibility.

    Compare final FP32 and FP16 outputs (e.g., max error, SSIM/PSNR if applicable).

    Summarize any trade-offs between speed and output fidelity.

Do not modify the model architecture or do anything that would invalidate the current weights.

_________________


PROMPT 3:

There are several optimizations that still need to be tested in the current workflow. Focus on the following:

    Use memory_format=torch.channels_last — Evaluate whether switching to the channels-last memory format improves CUDA performance, particularly in FP16 mode.

    Cache img0 — If the first input frame (or reference frame) is reused across iterations, test the effect of caching it in memory instead of reloading or reprocessing it each time.

In addition to the above, actively search for any further performance improvements that:

    Preserve exact output consistency

    Do not modify the model architecture

    Keep the workflow fully compatible with the existing weights (rife46.pth)

Your goals:

    Apply safe and effective performance optimizations

    Measure and compare inference speed, GPU memory usage, and CUDA utilization

    Ensure output accuracy is preserved across all changes

    Compare final results between optimized FP32 and FP16 runs

Document:

    Which optimizations helped, and why

    Which had negligible or negative impact

    Any remaining bottlenecks or potential gains

Prompt 4:

Excellent work, Sonnet.

Now, instead of maintaining multiple scripts like benchmark.py, advanced_benchmark.py, etc., I want a single, unified benchmarking script that encapsulates all the optimizations you've implemented so far. This script should:

    Run and compare both baseline and optimized inference in:

        FP32

        FP16

    Include the following tested and validated optimizations:

        torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

        torch.channels_last memory format

        torch.cuda.amp.autocast() for FP16

        Preloading/caching of input frames (e.g., img0)

        Efficient memory reuse and CUDA execution strategies

        Any other previously validated improvements

    Measure and report:

        Frames per second (FPS)

        CUDA memory usage

        Output consistency across all modes (using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, or max error)

    Ensure that:

        No changes affect model structure or break compatibility with the existing weights (rife46.pth)

        The outputs from optimized FP32 and FP16 are as close as possible to the baseline FP32

The script should output a clear, human-readable comparison summary showing:

    Baseline FP32 vs. Optimized FP32

    Baseline FP16 vs. Optimized FP16

    Optimized FP32 vs. Optimized FP16 (accuracy differences)

------------

Prompt 5:

Make sure to update the README.md with all your latest findings, results, and any other details you deem useful.

The updated README.md should include:

    Performance benchmarks for both FP32 and FP16:

        Baseline vs. Optimized (FPS, memory usage, GPU utilization)

        Output comparison metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR, max error)

    A clear list of all applied optimizations, with brief explanations:

        torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

        torch.channels_last memory format

        torch.cuda.amp.autocast() for FP16

        Caching of img0 and any other memory reuse strategies

        Other CUDA, threading, or memory management improvements

    Instructions to run the unified benchmarking script:

        Requirements and dependencies

        Setup steps

        How to invoke different test modes (baseline vs optimized, FP32 vs FP16)

        Example output

Also:

    Document any known trade-offs or stability notes

    Clarify that model weights remain unchanged and fully compatible

    Optionally, include a “Tips for Further Optimization” section

Additionally, add a .gitignore file that includes all entries relevant to Python projects, such as:

    __pycache__/

    .pyc, .pyo, .pyd

    .env, .venv, env/, venv/

    .DS_Store, .idea/, .vscode/

    *.log, *.pth, etc.

Let me know if you'd like a generated .gitignore or README.md template to start from.

PROMPT 6:

    Replicate and extend the same level of performance and quality improvements you achieved with RIFE 4.6:

        FP32 and FP16 baseline benchmarking

    Apply and explore additional optimizations, including but not limited to:

        torch.channels_last memory format
